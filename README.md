2. **Study by Domain**: Focus on your target role's requirements
   ```bash
   # For Go backend roles
   general-questions.md → golang/intermediate.md → sql/design.md
   
   # For API development roles
   general-questions.md → api/api.md → api/rest.md
   ```

3. **Practice with Formats**: Use structured interview formats for comprehensive preparation
   ```bash
   interviews/junior-go-developer.md     # Entry level
   interviews/intermediate-go-developer.md # Mid level
   interviews/senior-go-developer.md     # Senior level
   ```

### For Conducting Interviews

1. **Choose Format**: Select appropriate interview format based on candidate level
